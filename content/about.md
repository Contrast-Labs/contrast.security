Contrast Security is an Application Security platform that helps companies realize the full potential of DevSecOps in modern software.



### Executive Summary

Traditional application security solutions have increasingly limited effectiveness when it comes to reducing vulnerabilities in software development processes, keeping track of open-source software (OSS) components, and protecting applications in production. The Contrast Application Security Platform uses instrumentation to observe, analyze, and protect software from within the application. In doing so, Contrast makes security continuous and integrates seamlessly with modern software - from development into production. In addition, this approach offers an unprecedented application security orchestration layer to improve enterprisewide risk reporting and policy enforcement.


### Contrast Labs
